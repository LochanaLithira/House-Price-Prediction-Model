Outliers handle 
    What you should do right now:

    Train your model on the data exactly as it is (with the outliers included).

    Check the MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

    Look at the "Worst Predictions":

    If your model predicts $2M for the $8M house, then the outlier is a problem.

    Then (and only then) do we come back and apply Winsorization (Capping).
